# VirtualZoo
We would like you to describe the classes, interfaces and methods you would use to implement the animals in a Virtual Zoo, showing how
you would re-use code between animals.
Each animal needs to eat and to move (they can walk, fly or swim).
Include definitions for Monkey, Dolphin, Bat and Penguin. And at least, include the implementation for Duck.
You can use pseudo-code if you wish, as we are mostly focusing on your approach and not the syntax.
